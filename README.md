## Problem It Solves

Manually reviewing **24 hours of CCTV footage** is **tedious, slow, and error-prone**.  
Whether it's a home, office, or small business **finding the moment someone entered the gate** takes forever.

> **Sentinel AI watches for you.**  
> It scans footage, detects **people entering/exiting**, and delivers a **clean summary** with **exact timestamps**.

```text
[14:32:11] Person entered front gate
[14:33:05] Person exited with bag
[02:11:47] Person detected in backyard (night, IR mode)
